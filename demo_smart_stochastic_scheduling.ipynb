    "K-fold cross-validation is a model evaluation technique that helps assess a model's performance on unseen data. It is widely used to reduce the risk of overfitting, estimate the generalization error, and select the best model. The dataset is divided into k equally-sized folds (or partitions), where k is a positive integer (in our case five). The model is trained on k-1 folds and validated on the remaining fold. This process is repeated k times, ensuring that each fold is used as the validation set exactly once.\n",
    "\n",
    "In scikit-learn's KFold class, the parameters n_splits, shuffle, and random_state have the following meanings:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **n_splits**: The number of folds (k) to divide the dataset into. This parameter should be set to a positive integer (typically between 5 and 10). Higher values of k result in a lower bias but higher variance in model evaluation, whereas lower values of k can lead to a higher bias but lower variance.\n",
    "2. **shuffle**: This is a boolean parameter. When set to True, the dataset will be shuffled before splitting into folds. Shuffling is useful when the dataset has an inherent order that might affect the model's performance during cross-validation. When set to False, the dataset will not be shuffled before splitting, and the folds will be created by sequentially selecting data points.\n",
    "3. **random_state**: This parameter is used to control the randomness when shuffling the dataset. If set to an integer, it serves as the seed for the random number generator, ensuring that the shuffling is consistent across multiple runs. This helps in achieving reproducible results. When set to None, the random number generator uses a different seed in each run, resulting in a different shuffling of the dataset.\n",

    "**Regression models:**\n",
    "Regression is a supervised learning technique used for predicting continuous numerical values. It is a statistical method that models the relationship between a dependent variable (also known as the target or response variable) and one or more independent variables (also known as the predictors or explanatory variables). Source: https://scikit-learn.org/stable/supervised_learning.html\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are brief descriptions of some popular regression models:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Linear Regression**: Linear regression is a simple and widely used linear approach to modeling the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. It assumes a linear relationship between the variables and tries to fit a straight line through the data that minimizes the sum of the squared errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Ridge Regression**: Ridge regression is a regularized version of linear regression that adds a penalty term to the cost function to prevent overfitting. It uses L2 regularization to shrink the coefficients towards zero, which reduces the variance of the estimates and improves the model's generalization performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Lasso Regression**: Lasso regression is another regularized version of linear regression that uses L1 regularization to shrink the coefficients towards zero. It can be used for feature selection, as it tends to drive some coefficients to exactly zero, which removes the corresponding predictors from the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Elastic Regression**: Elastic regression is a combination of ridge and lasso regression that uses a mixture of L1 and L2 regularization to balance the benefits of both. It can be tuned to favor either L1 or L2 regularization, or a mixture of both.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Decision Tree Regression**: Decision tree regression is a non-parametric method that recursively splits the data into subsets based on the values of the predictors, and fits a simple model (such as a constant value) in each subset. It is easy to interpret and can capture non-linear relationships between the variables, but can suffer from overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Random Forest Regression**: Random forest regression is an ensemble method that combines multiple decision tree regressors to improve the prediction accuracy and reduce overfitting. It randomly selects subsets of the data and variables to build each tree, and aggregates the predictions of the trees to produce the final output.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Gradient Boosting Regression**: Gradient boosting regression is another ensemble method that combines multiple weak models (such as decision trees) to produce a strong predictive model. It trains each model sequentially to correct the errors of the previous model, and uses gradient descent to minimize the loss function.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **XGBoost**: XGBoost is an optimized implementation of gradient boosting that uses a variety of techniques (such as regularization, early stopping, and parallel processing) to improve the performance and scalability of the algorithm. It is often used in machine learning competitions and has been shown to achieve state-of-the-art results on a wide range of datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hyperparameter tuning:**\n",
    "Hyperparameter tuning is the process of finding the best set of hyperparameters for a machine learning model to optimize its performance. Hyperparameters are configuration variables that govern the training process and cannot be learned directly from the data. They can have a significant impact on the model's performance, and thus, finding the right combination is crucial for building a successful model. In this case the hyperparameter tuning is done with GridSearchCV. Source: https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/grid_search.html"
